Supersaturation Rate Numerical Calculator (SupersatRN-C) is a simple software package for simulating mass transfer in thin-film solution printing of perovskite absorber layers. It allows the calculation of thickness transients of solution films for different methods of increasing the supersaturation, so-called quenching techniques. The core is an ODE solver working on multicomponent mass trasnfer equations introduced in the publication [ref]. The mass transfer is determined Sherwood correlations from textbooks - distilled in 'correlations.py'. The material properties of the perovskite solutions and their respective literature sources are encoded in the file 'material_properties.py' and defined as classes in 'materials.py'. The software package is provided with the funcionality of the two solution formulations Methylammonium Lead Iodide (MAPI) dissolved in N,N-Dimethylformamide and Double Cation Perovsktie (DCP) dissolved in Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO):DMF:Gamma-Butyrolactone (GBL). However, it is deliberately designed to be extensible and modular, so that more solution formulations can be added in the future. The principal output parameter of the SupersatRN-C is the supersaturation rate calculated by the temporal derivative of 
ln(C/C0)  at the point in time where the film reaches critical concentration. 

### Basic Features
The basic features of SupersatRN-C are 

* Calculation of dynamic evolution of film thickness part of every component in a perovskite solution film for different solutions and different processing methods.
* Systematic treatment of necessary processing parameters for full specification, providing a transparent documentation of their impact on the mass transfer dynamics.
* Determination of supersaturation rates of all common quenching methods used in perovskite solution processing, enabling quantitative comparison between these.
* Intuitive visualization of mass transfer dynamics along with a plot of supersaturation, supersaturation rate and optionally interferometric data.
* Possibility of regime-based processing methods combining arbitrary methods and/or activity changes within the solution.
* Possibility to fit activity coefficients based on interferometric data.
